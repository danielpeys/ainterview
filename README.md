Ainterview is a web application built with SvelteKit that helps you prepare for job interviews. It takes job description input either by text or via a URL and presents you with interview questions based on the job requirements. You can answer the questions using text input or by speaking, and you will receive an evaluation of your answers after each question.

## Features

Ainterview offers the following key features:

1. **Job Description Analysis:** Provide a job description either by entering text or providing a URL, and Ainterview will analyze the job requirements to generate relevant interview questions.
